# Overview

Here I used previous knowledge of html and css combined with new knowledge learning javascript to make a To-Do List

This software is a To-Do checklist. You can add to-do's to the list, check them, and remove them. It also has a save function for when the page exits or refreshes, so you dont lose any previous data you entered.

My purpose for making this software is to become more comfortable with javascript

This was created with html, css, and javascript
